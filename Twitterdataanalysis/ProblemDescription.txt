This analysis is nothing but a simple map-reduce on Hadoop that analyses data from Twitter.
To execute this project on windows system, WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux)2 is required and then Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 LTS.


Problem Description:
The dataset used for analyses is real data from Twitter from 2010. The dataset represents a graph that contains links between tweeting users in the form: userID,followerID.

For eg:

7,5
7,8
8,9

Here user 5,8 are follower of user 7, whereas user 9 is a follower of 8. Now, for each twitter user we should count no.of followers and group them by their count.


For Eg:

5 6 : This says there are 6 users who follow 5 users. Solve this problem using two map-reduce jobs on Hadoop in java programming language.
